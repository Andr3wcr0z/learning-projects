# learning-projects
Where I learn to code with different programming languages

I actually don't know what I'm doing (but, shhhh, don't tell nobody)

### The 'learning.sh' shellscript is a script I made to direct me to my learning directory
## Rust directory is based on the Rust docs. (Some programs will be the exact replica, and some will be different or unique)
